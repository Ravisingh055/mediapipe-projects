# mediapipe-projects
 🧠 Vision-Based Interaction Projects (MediaPipe + OpenCV) This repository showcases a collection of computer vision projects built using MediaPipe and OpenCV, focused on enabling intuitive human-computer interaction through hand and eye gestures. The projects demonstrate real-time control systems powered by webcam input, gesture recognition, and tracking.  🔧 Projects Included: 👁️ Eye Cursor: Control the mouse pointer using your eye movements tracked via facial landmarks.  🤚 Hand Cursor: Move and click the cursor using hand gestures and position tracking.  🎨 Virtual Painter (Hand Gesture Paint): A gesture-based virtual painting tool that lets you draw, erase, and switch colors using your fingers.  📦 Technologies Used: MediaPipe (for landmark detection)  OpenCV (for image processing and display)  Python  🚀 Features: Real-time performance using a standard webcam  Gesture recognition for smooth interaction  Minimal UI, focused on natural input control  Beginner-friendly code with clear structure
